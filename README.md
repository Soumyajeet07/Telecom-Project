# Telecom-Project
Final project
We have created a simple telecom service project using Java, Springboot, Oracle and jsp. 
The new user will have to register with their name, phone number, password and enter the amount they want to credit to the operator.
The user will then have the option to recharge their account.After signing out the existing users will have to login again with their number and password.
If an exisiting phone number is entered then it will give an exception ("Phone number already exists").
If incorrect number is given then also an excpetion will be raised ("Incorrect phone number").
For future purposes a payment method can be introduced for transferring money between the users.
